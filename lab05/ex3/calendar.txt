 The java.util.Calendar class likely employs various design patterns to enhance its flexibility and maintainability. It likely 
uses Factory and Template Method patterns for flexible instantiation and structured algorithm implementation. Additionally, it may 
utilize Strategy and Singleton patterns for adaptable strategy implementation and centralized instance management. Elements of State 
and Observer patterns might also be present for managing internal states and notifying observers of changes. These patterns collectively contribute to 
the class's robustness and suitability for diverse use cases.
